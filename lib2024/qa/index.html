				<strong>Question: 2</strong>
				Define version control and give one example.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Answer: </strong>
				“Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
				If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you make a mistake or lose files, you can easily recover.”
